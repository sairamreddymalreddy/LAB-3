The Lab-3 Physics-Based Motion Control SystemIn this lab I have considered bounding spheres as the objects in the scene.The input:1. Data like number of objects(NUM_SPHERES) and dt = 0.016(change dt as per requirement) 2. physics propertiesmassradius of sphere(radius)restitutionfloorLevelgroundFrictionmoment of Inertia is calculated on formula I=2/5 m r^2and some other like Linear velocity,Position,Angular velocity,Inital oriention(roll,pitch,yaw) are taken random using rand() func for more accurate display of animation I have made ne component color which RGB values are generated random b) Physical properties of the objects (e.g., mass, moment of inertia, friction,coefficient of restitution)c) Initial conditions
